1 API Reference
***************

1.1 Introduction
================

This document describes all commands currently supported by QMP.

Most of the time their usage is exactly the same as in the user Monitor,
this means that any other document which also describe commands (the
manpage, QEMU's manual, etc) can and should be consulted.

QMP has two types of commands: regular and query commands.  Regular
commands usually change the Virtual Machine's state someway, while query
commands just return information.  The sections below are divided
accordingly.

It's important to observe that all communication examples are formatted
in a reader-friendly way, so that they're easier to understand.
However, in real protocol usage, they're emitted as a single line.

Also, the following notation is used to denote data flow:

Example:

     -> data issued by the Client

     <- Server data response

Please, refer to the QMP specification (docs/interop/qmp-spec.txt) for
detailed information on the Server command and response formats.

1.2 Stability Considerations
============================

The current QMP command set (described in this file) may be useful for a
number of use cases, however it's limited and several commands have bad
defined semantics, specially with regard to command completion.

These problems are going to be solved incrementally in the next QEMU
releases and we're going to establish a deprecation policy for badly
defined commands.

If you're planning to adopt QMP, please observe the following:

  1. The deprecation policy will take effect and be documented soon,
     please check the documentation of each used command as soon as a
     new release of QEMU is available

  2. DO NOT rely on anything which is not explicit documented

  3. Errors, in special, are not documented.  Applications should NOT
     check for specific errors classes or data (it's strongly
     recommended to only check for the "error" key)

1.3 QAPI common definitions
===========================

 -- Enum: QapiErrorClass

     QEMU error classes

     Values:
     'GenericError'
          this is used for errors that don't require a specific error
          class.  This should be the default case for most errors
     'CommandNotFound'
          the requested command has not been found
     'DeviceNotActive'
          a device has failed to be become active
     'DeviceNotFound'
          the requested device has not been found
     'KVMMissingCap'
          the requested operation can't be fulfilled because a required
          KVM capability is missing

     Since: 1.2

 -- Object: VersionTriple

     A three-part version number.

     Members:
     'major: int'
          The major version number.
     'minor: int'
          The minor version number.
     'micro: int'
          The micro version number.

     Since: 2.4

 -- Object: VersionInfo

     A description of QEMU's version.

     Members:
     'qemu: VersionTriple'
          The version of QEMU. By current convention, a micro version of
          50 signifies a development branch.  A micro version greater
          than or equal to 90 signifies a release candidate for the next
          minor version.  A micro version of less than 50 signifies a
          stable release.
     'package: string'
          QEMU will always set this field to an empty string.
          Downstream versions of QEMU should set this to a non-empty
          string.  The exact format depends on the downstream however it
          highly recommended that a unique name is used.

     Since: 0.14.0

 -- Command: query-version

     Returns the current version of QEMU.

          <- {
               "return":[
                  {
                     "name":"query-balloon"
                  },

                  }
               ]

 -- Object: BlockMeasureInfo

     Image file size calculation information.  This structure describes
     the size requirements for creating a new image file.

     The size requirements depend on the new image file format.  File
     size always equals virtual disk size for the 'raw' format, even for
     sparse POSIX files.  Compact formats such as 'qcow2' represent
     unallocated and zero regions efficiently so file size may be
     smaller than virtual disk size.

     The values are upper bounds that are guaranteed to fit the new
     image file.  Subsequent modification, such as internal snapshot or
     bitmap creation, may require additional space and is not covered
     here.

     Members:
     'required: int'
          Size required for a new image file, in bytes.
     'fully-allocated: int'
          Image file size, in bytes, once data has been written to all
          sectors.

 -- Command: query-blockstats

     Query the 'BlockStats' for all virtual block devices.

     Arguments:
     'query-nodes: boolean' (optional)
          If true, the command will query all the block nodes that have
          a node name, in a list which will include "parent"
          information, but not "backing".  If false or omitted, the
          behavior is as before - query all the device backends,
          recursively including their "parent" and "backing".  Filter
          nodes that were created implicitly are skipped over in this
          mode.  (Since 2.3)

     Returns: A list of 'BlockStats' for each virtual block devices.

     Generates a synchronous snapshot of a block device.

     For the arguments, see the documentation of BlockdevSnapshotSync.

     Returns: nothing on success If 'device' is not a valid block
     device, DeviceNotFound

     Since: 0.14.0

     Example:
          -> { "execute": "blockdev-snapshot-sync",

          <- { "return": {} }

 -- Command: blockdev-snapshot

     Generates a snapshot of a block device.

     Create a snapshot, by installing 'node' as the backing image of
     'overlay'.  Additionally, if 'node' is associated with a block
     device, the block device changes to using 'overlay' as its new
     active image.

     For the arguments, see the documentation of BlockdevSnapshot.

     Since: 2.5

     Example:
          -> { "execute": "blockdev-add",
               "arguments": { "driver": "qcow2",
                              "node-name": "node1534",
                              "file": { "driver": "file",

 -- Command: change-backing-file

     Change the backing file in the image file metadata.  This does not
     cause QEMU to reopen the image file to reparse the backing filename
     (it may, however, perform a reopen to change permissions from r/o
     -> r/w -> r/o, if needed).  The new backing file string is written
     into the image file metadata, and the QEMU internal strings are
     updated.

     Arguments:
     'image-node-name: string'
          The name of the block driver state node of the image to
          modify.  The "device" argument is used to verify
          "image-node-name" is in the chain described by "device".
     'device: string'
          The device name or node-name of the root node that owns
          image-node-name.
     'backing-file: string'
          The string to write as the backing file.  This string is not
          validated, so care should be taken when specifying the string
          or the image chain may not be able to be reopened again.

     Returns: Nothing on success

     If "device" does not exist or cannot be determined, DeviceNotFound

     Since: 2.1

 -- Command: block-commit

     Live commit of data from overlay image nodes into backing nodes -
     i.e., writes data between 'top' and 'base' into 'base'.

     Arguments:
     'job-id: string' (optional)
          identifier for the newly-created block job.  If omitted, the
          device name will be used.  (Since 2.7)
     'device: string'
          the device name or node-name of a root node
     'base: string' (optional)
          The file name of the backing image to write data into.  If not
          specified, this is the deepest backing image.
     'top: string' (optional)
          The file name of the backing image within the image chain,
          which contains the topmost data to be committed down.  If not
          specified, this is the active layer.
     'backing-file: string' (optional)
          The backing file string to write into the overlay image of
          'top'.  If 'top' is the active layer, specifying a backing
          file string is an error.  This filename is not validated.

          If a pathname string is such that it cannot be resolved by
          QEMU, that means that subsequent QMP or HMP commands must use
          node-names for the image in question, as filename lookup
          methods will fail.

          If not specified, QEMU will automatically determine the
          backing file string to use, or error out if there is no
          obvious choice.  Care should be taken when specifying the
          string, to specify a valid filename or protocol.  (Since 2.1)

          If top == base, that is an error.  If top == active, the job
          will not be completed by itself, user needs to complete the
          job with the block-job-complete command after getting the
          ready event.  (Since 2.0)

          If the base image is smaller than top, then the base image
          will be resized to be the same size as top.  If top is smaller
          than the base image, the base will not be truncated.  If you
          want the base image size to match the size of the smaller top,
          you can safely truncate it yourself once the commit operation
          successfully completes.
     'speed: int' (optional)
          the maximum speed, in bytes per second
     'filter-node-name: string' (optional)
          the node name that should be assigned to the filter driver
          that the commit job inserts into the graph above 'top'.  If
          this option is not given, a node name is autogenerated.
          (Since: 2.9)

     Returns: Nothing on success If commit or stream is already active
     on this device, DeviceInUse If 'device' does not exist,
     DeviceNotFound If image commit is not supported by this device,
     NotSupported If 'base' or 'top' is invalid, a generic error is
     returned If 'speed' is invalid, InvalidParameter

 -- Command: block_set_io_throttle

     Change I/O throttle limits for a block drive.

     Since QEMU 2.4, each device with I/O limits is member of a throttle
     group.

     If two or more devices are members of the same group, the limits
     will apply to the combined I/O of the whole group in a round-robin
     fashion.  Therefore, setting new I/O limits to a device will affect
     the whole group.

     The name of the group can be specified using the 'group' parameter.
     If the parameter is unset, it is assumed to be the current group of
     that device.  If it's not in any group yet, the name of the device
     will be used as the name for its group.

     The 'group' parameter can also be used to move a device to a
     different group.  In this case the limits specified in the
     parameters will be applied to the new group only.

     I/O limits can be disabled by setting all of them to 0.  In this
     case the device will be removed from its group and the rest of its
     members will not be affected.  The 'group' parameter is ignored.

     Arguments: the members of 'BlockIOThrottle'

     Returns: Nothing on success If 'device' is not a valid block
     device, DeviceNotFound

     Since: 1.1

 -- Command: block-stream

     Copy data from a backing file into a block device.

     The block streaming operation is performed in the background until
     the entire backing file has been copied.  This command returns
     immediately once streaming has started.  The status of ongoing
     block streaming operations can be checked with query-block-jobs.
     The operation can be stopped before it has completed using the
     block-job-cancel command.

     The node that receives the data is called the top image, can be
     located in any part of the chain (but always above the base image;
     see below) and can be specified using its device or node name.
     Earlier qemu versions only allowed 'device' to name the top level
     node; presence of the 'base-node' parameter during introspection
     can be used as a witness of the enhanced semantics of 'device'.

     If a base file is specified then sectors are not copied from that
     base file and its backing chain.  When streaming completes the
     image file will have the base file as its backing file.  This can
     be used to stream a subset of the backing file chain instead of
     flattening the entire image.

     On successful completion the image file is updated to drop the
     backing file and the BLOCK_JOB_COMPLETED event is emitted.

     Arguments:
     'job-id: string' (optional)
          identifier for the newly-created block job.  If omitted, the
          device name will be used.  (Since 2.7)
     'device: string'
          the device or node name of the top image
     'base: string' (optional)
          the common backing file name.  It cannot be set if 'base-node'
          is also set.
     'base-node: string' (optional)
          the node name of the backing file.  It cannot be set if 'base'
          is also set.  (Since 2.8)
     'backing-file: string' (optional)
          The backing file string to write into the top image.  This
          filename is not validated.

          If a pathname string is such that it cannot be resolved by
          QEMU, that means that subsequent QMP or HMP commands must use
          node-names for the image in question, as filename lookup
          methods will fail.

          If not specified, QEMU will automatically determine the
          backing file string to use, or error out if there is no
          obvious choice.  Care should be taken when specifying the
          string, to specify a valid filename or protocol.  (Since 2.1)
     'speed: int' (optional)
          the maximum speed, in bytes per second
     'on-error: BlockdevOnError' (optional)
          the action to take on an error (default report).  'stop' and
          'enospc' can only be used if the block device supports
          io-status (see BlockInfo).  Since 1.3.

     Returns: Nothing on success.  If 'device' does not exist,
     DeviceNotFound.

     Since: 1.1

     Example:
          -> { "execute": "block-stream",
               "arguments": { "device": "virtio0",
                              "base": "/tmp/master.qcow2" } }
          <- { "return": {} }

 -- Command: block-job-set-speed

     Set maximum speed for a background block operation.

     This command can only be issued when there is an active block job.

     Throttling can be disabled by setting the speed to 0.

     Arguments:
     'device: string'
          The job identifier.  This used to be a device name (hence the
          name of the parameter), but since QEMU 2.7 it can have other
          values.
     'speed: int'
          the maximum speed, in bytes per second, or 0 for unlimited.
          Defaults to 0.

     Returns: Nothing on success If no background operation is active on
     this device, DeviceNotActive

     Since: 1.1

 -- Command: block-job-cancel

     Stop an active background block operation.

     This command returns immediately after marking the active
     background block operation for cancellation.  It is an error to
     call this command if no operation is in progress.

     The operation will cancel as soon as possible and then emit the
     BLOCK_JOB_CANCELLED event.  Before that happens the job is still
     visible when enumerated using query-block-jobs.

     For streaming, the image file retains its backing file unless the
     streaming operation happens to complete just as it is being
     cancelled.  A new streaming operation can be started at a later
     time to finish copying all data from the backing file.

     Arguments:
     'device: string'
          The job identifier.  This used to be a device name (hence the
          name of the parameter), but since QEMU 2.7 it can have other
          values.
     'force: boolean' (optional)
          whether to allow cancellation of a paused job (default false).
          Since 1.3.

     Returns: Nothing on success If no background operation is active on
     this device, DeviceNotActive

     Since: 1.1

 -- Command: block-job-pause

     Pause an active background block operation.

     This command returns immediately after marking the active
     background block operation for pausing.  It is an error to call
     this command if no operation is in progress.  Pausing an already
     paused job has no cumulative effect; a single block-job-resume
     command will resume the job.

     The operation will pause as soon as possible.  No event is emitted
     when the operation is actually paused.  Cancelling a paused job
     automatically resumes it.

     Arguments:
     'device: string'
          The job identifier.  This used to be a device name (hence the
          name of the parameter), but since QEMU 2.7 it can have other
          values.

     Returns: Nothing on success If no background operation is active on
     this device, DeviceNotActive

     Since: 1.3

 -- Command: block-job-resume

     Resume an active background block operation.

     This command returns immediately after resuming a paused background
     block operation.  It is an error to call this command if no
     operation is in progress.  Resuming an already running job is not
     an error.

     This command also clears the error status of the job.

     Arguments:
     'device: string'
          The job identifier.  This used to be a device name (hence the
          name of the parameter), but since QEMU 2.7 it can have other
          values.

     Returns: Nothing on success If no background operation is active on
     this device, DeviceNotActive

     Since: 1.3

 -- Command: block-job-complete

     Manually trigger completion of an active background block
     operation.  This is supported for drive mirroring, where it also
     switches the device to write to the target path only.  The ability
     to complete is signaled with a BLOCK_JOB_READY event.

     This command completes an active background block operation
     synchronously.  The ordering of this command's return with the
     BLOCK_JOB_COMPLETED event is not defined.  Note that if an I/O
     error occurs during the processing of this command: 1) the command
     itself will fail; 2) the error will be processed according to the
     rerror/werror arguments that were specified when starting the
     operation.

     A cancelled or paused job cannot be completed.

     Arguments:
     'device: string'
          The job identifier.  This used to be a device name (hence the
          name of the parameter), but since QEMU 2.7 it can have other
          values.

     Returns: Nothing on success If no background operation is active on
     this device, DeviceNotActive

     Since: 1.3

 -- Command: blockdev-add

     Creates a new block device.  If the 'id' option is given at the top
     level, a BlockBackend will be created; otherwise, 'node-name' is
     mandatory at the top level and no BlockBackend will be created.

     Arguments: the members of 'BlockdevOptions'

 -- Command: blockdev-del

     Deletes a block device that has been added using blockdev-add.  The
     command will fail if the node is attached to a device or is
     otherwise being used.

     Arguments:
     'node-name: string'
          Name of the graph node to delete.

     Since: 2.9

     Example:
          -> { "execute": "blockdev-add",
               "arguments": {

             }
          <- { "return": {} }

 -- Command: blockdev-open-tray

     Opens a block device's tray.  If there is a block driver state tree
     inserted as a medium, it will become inaccessible to the guest (but
     it will remain associated to the block device, so closing the tray
     will make it accessible again).

     If the tray was already open before, this will be a no-op.

     Once the tray opens, a DEVICE_TRAY_MOVED event is emitted.  There
     are cases in which no such event will be generated, these include:
        - if the guest has locked the tray, 'force' is false and the
          guest does not respond to the eject request
        - if the BlockBackend denoted by 'device' does not have a guest
          device attached to it
        - if the guest device does not have an actual tray

     Arguments:
     'device: string' (optional)
          Block device name (deprecated, use 'id' instead)
     'id: string' (optional)
          The name or QOM path of the guest device (since: 2.8)
     'force: boolean' (optional)
          if false (the default), an eject request will be sent to the
          guest if it has locked the tray (and the tray will not be
          opened immediately); if true, the tray will be opened
          regardless of whether it is locked

     Since: 2.5

     Example:
          -> { "execute": "blockdev-open-tray",
               "arguments": { "id": "ide0-1-0" } }

          <- { "timestamp": { "seconds": 1418751016,

          <- { "return": {} }

 -- Command: blockdev-close-tray

     Closes a block device's tray.  If there is a block driver state
     tree associated with the block device (which is currently ejected),
     that tree will be loaded as the medium.

     If the tray was already closed before, this will be a no-op.

          <- { "return": {} }

 -- Command: x-blockdev-remove-medium

     Removes a medium (a block driver state tree) from a block device.
     That block device's tray must currently be open (unless there is no
     attached guest device).

     If the tray is open and there is no medium inserted, this will be a
     no-op.

     Arguments:
     'device: string' (optional)
          Block device name (deprecated, use 'id' instead)
     'id: string' (optional)
          The name or QOM path of the guest device (since: 2.8)

     if the image does not have a device name associated.

     Arguments:
     'device: string'
          device name.  This is always present for compatibility
          reasons, but it can be empty ("") if the image does not have a

     'node-name: string'
          node name.  Note that errors may be reported for the root node
          that is directly attached to a guest device rather than for
          the node where the error occurred.  (Since: 2.8)
     'operation: IoOperationType'
          I/O operation
     'action: BlockErrorAction'
          action that has been taken
     'nospace: boolean' (optional)
          true if I/O error was caused due to a no-space condition.
          This key is only present if query-block's io-status is
          present, please see query-block documentation for more
          information (since: 2.2)
     'reason: string'
          human readable string describing the error cause.  (This field
          is a debugging aid for humans, it should not be parsed by

          job type
     'device: string'
          The job identifier.  Originally the device name but other

 -- Enum: PreallocMode

     Preallocation mode of QEMU image file

     Values:
     'off'
          no preallocation
     'metadata'
          preallocate only for metadata
     'falloc'
          like 'full' preallocation but allocate disk space by
          posix_fallocate() rather than writing zeros.
     'full'
          preallocate all data by writing zeros to device to ensure disk
          space is really available.  'full' preallocation also sets up
          metadata correctly.

     Since: 2.2

 -- Event: BLOCK_WRITE_THRESHOLD

     Emitted when writes on block device reaches or exceeds the
     configured write threshold.  For thin-provisioned devices, this
     means the device should be extended to avoid pausing for disk
     exhaustion.  The event is one shot.  Once triggered, it needs to be
     re-registered with another block-set-write-threshold command.

     Arguments:
     'node-name: string'
          graph node name on which the threshold was exceeded.
     'amount-exceeded: int'
          amount of data which exceeded the threshold, in bytes.
     'write-threshold: int'
          last configured threshold, in bytes.

     Since: 2.3

 -- Command: block-set-write-threshold

     Change the write threshold for a block drive.  An event will be
     delivered if a write to this block drive crosses the configured
     threshold.  The threshold is an offset, thus must be non-negative.
     Default is no write threshold.  Setting the threshold to zero
     disables it.

     This is useful to transparently resize thin-provisioned drives
     without the guest OS noticing.

     Arguments:
     'node-name: string'
          graph node name on which the threshold must be set.
     'write-threshold: int'
          configured threshold for the block device, bytes.  Use 0 to
          disable the threshold.

     Since: 2.3

     Example:
          -> { "execute": "block-set-write-threshold",
               "arguments": { "node-name": "mydev",
                              "write-threshold": 17179869184 } }
          <- { "return": {} }

 -- Command: x-blockdev-change

     Dynamically reconfigure the block driver state graph.  It can be
     used to add, remove, insert or replace a graph node.  Currently
     only the Quorum driver implements this feature to add or remove its
     child.  This is useful to fix a broken quorum child.

     If 'node' is specified, it will be inserted under 'parent'.
     'child' may not be specified in this case.  If both 'parent' and
     'child' are specified but 'node' is not, 'child' will be detached
     from 'parent'.

     Arguments:
     'parent: string'
          the id or name of the parent node.
     'child: string' (optional)
          the name of a child under the given parent node.
     'node: string' (optional)
          the name of the node that will be added.

     Note: this command is experimental, and its API is not stable.  It
     does not support all kinds of operations, all kinds of children,
     nor all block drivers.

     Warning: The data in a new quorum child MUST be consistent with
     that of the rest of the array.

     Since: 2.7

     Example:
          1. Add a new node to a quorum
          -> { "execute": "blockdev-add",
               "arguments": {
                   "driver": "raw",
                   "node-name": "new_node",
                   "file": { "driver": "file",
                             "filename": "test.raw" } } }
          <- { "return": {} }
          -> { "execute": "x-blockdev-change",
               "arguments": { "parent": "disk1",
                              "node": "new_node" } }
          <- { "return": {} }

          2. Delete a quorum's node
          -> { "execute": "x-blockdev-change",
               "arguments": { "parent": "disk1",
                              "child": "children.1" } }
          <- { "return": {} }

1.5.2 QAPI block definitions (vm unrelated)
-------------------------------------------

 -- Enum: BiosAtaTranslation

     Policy that BIOS should use to interpret cylinder/head/sector
     addresses.  Note that Bochs BIOS and SeaBIOS will not actually
     translate logical CHS to physical; instead, they will use logical
     block addressing.

     Values:
     'auto'
          If cylinder/heads/sizes are passed, choose between none and
          LBA depending on the size of the disk.  If they are not
          passed, choose none if QEMU can guess that the disk had 16 or
          fewer heads, large if QEMU can guess that the disk had 131072
          or fewer tracks across all heads (i.e.
          cylinders*heads<131072), otherwise LBA.
     'none'
          The physical disk geometry is equal to the logical geometry.
     'lba'
          Assume 63 sectors per track and one of 16, 32, 64, 128 or 255
          heads (if fewer than 255 are enough to cover the whole disk
          with 1024 cylinders/head).  The number of cylinders/head is
          then computed based on the number of sectors and heads.
     'large'
          The number of cylinders per head is scaled down to 1024 by
          correspondingly scaling up the number of heads.
     'rechs'
          Same as 'large', but first convert a 16-head geometry to
          15-head, by proportionally scaling up the number of
          cylinders/head.

     Since: 2.0

 -- Enum: FloppyDriveType

     Since: 1.7

 -- Command: blockdev-snapshot-internal-sync

     Synchronously take an internal snapshot of a block device, when the
     format of the image used supports it.  If the name is an empty
     string, or a snapshot with name already exists, the operation will
     fail.

     For the arguments, see the documentation of
     BlockdevSnapshotInternal.

     Returns: nothing on success

     If 'device' is not a valid block device, GenericError

     'name: string' (optional)
          optional the snapshot's name to be deleted

     Returns: SnapshotInfo on success If 'device' is not a valid block
     device, GenericError If snapshot not found, GenericError If the
     format of the image used does not support it,
     BlockFormatFeatureNotSupported If 'id' and 'name' are both not
     specified, GenericError

          not specified, the default value is false.

     Returns: Nothing on success

     If 'device' is not a valid block device, DeviceNotFound

     Notes: Ejecting a device with no media results in success

     Since: 0.14.0

     Example:
          -> { "execute": "eject", "arguments": { "id": "ide1-0-1" } }
          <- { "return": {} }

 -- Command: nbd-server-start

     Start an NBD server listening on the given host and port.  Block
     devices can then be exported using 'nbd-server-add'.  The NBD
     server will present them as named exports; for example, another
     QEMU instance could refer to them as
     "nbd:HOST:PORT:exportname=NAME".

     guest or by HMP/QMP commands

     Arguments:
     'device: string'
          Block device name.  This is always present for compatibility
          reasons, but it can be empty ("") if the image does not have a
          device name associated.
     'id: string'
          The name or QOM path of the guest device (since 2.8)
     'tray-open: boolean'

1.6 Other events
================

 -- Event: SHUTDOWN

     Emitted when the virtual machine has shut down, indicating that
     qemu is about to exit.

     Arguments:
     'guest: boolean'
          If true, the shutdown was triggered by a guest request (such
          as a guest-initiated ACPI shutdown request or other
          hardware-specific action) rather than a host request (such as
          sending qemu a SIGINT). (since 2.10)

     Note: If the command-line option "-no-shutdown" has been specified,
     qemu will not exit, and a STOP event will eventually follow the
     SHUTDOWN event

     Since: 0.12.0

     Example:
          <- { "event": "SHUTDOWN", "data": { "guest": true },

 -- Event: RESET

     Emitted when the virtual machine is reset

     Arguments:
     'guest: boolean'
          If true, the reset was triggered by a guest request (such as a
          guest-initiated ACPI reboot request or other hardware-specific
          action) rather than a host request (such as the QMP command
          system_reset).  (since 2.10)

     Since: 0.12.0

     Example:
          <- { "event": "RESET", "data": { "guest": false },

               "timestamp": { "seconds": 1344456160, "microseconds": 309119 } }

 -- Event: SUSPEND_DISK

     Emitted when guest enters a hardware suspension state with data
     saved on disk, for example, S4 state, which is sometimes called
     hibernate state

     Note: QEMU shuts down (similar to event 'SHUTDOWN') when entering
     this state

     Since: 1.2

     Example:
          <-   { "event": "SUSPEND_DISK",

     Emitted when the watchdog device's timer is expired

     Arguments:
     'action: WatchdogExpirationAction'
          action that has been taken

     Note: If action is "reset", "shutdown", or "pause" the WATCHDOG
     event is followed respectively by the RESET, SHUTDOWN, or STOP
     events

     Note: This event is rate-limited.

     Since: 0.13.0

1.7 Tracing commands
====================

 -- Enum: TraceEventState

     State of a tracing event.

     Values:
     'unavailable'
          The event is statically disabled.
     'disabled'
          The event is dynamically disabled.
     'enabled'
          The event is dynamically enabled.

     Since: 2.2

 -- Object: TraceEventInfo

     Information of a tracing event.

     Members:
     'name: string'
          Event name.
     'state: TraceEventState'
          Tracing state.
     'vcpu: boolean'
          Whether this is a per-vCPU event (since 2.7).
     An event is per-vCPU if it has the "vcpu" property in the
     "trace-events" files.

     Since: 2.2

 -- Command: trace-event-get-state

     Query the state of events.

     Arguments:
     'name: string'
          Event name pattern (case-sensitive glob).
     'vcpu: int' (optional)
          The vCPU to query (any by default; since 2.7).

     Returns: a list of 'TraceEventInfo' for the matching events

     An event is returned if:
        - its name matches the 'name' pattern, and
        - if 'vcpu' is given, the event has the "vcpu" property.

     Therefore, if 'vcpu' is given, the operation will only match
     per-vCPU events, returning their state on the specified vCPU.
     Special case: if 'name' is an exact match, 'vcpu' is given and the
     event does not have the "vcpu" property, an error is returned.

     Since: 2.2

     Example:
          -> { "execute": "trace-event-get-state",
               "arguments": { "name": "qemu_memalign" } }
          <- { "return": [ { "name": "qemu_memalign", "state": "disabled" } ] }

 -- Command: trace-event-set-state

     Set the dynamic tracing state of events.

     Arguments:
     'name: string'
          Event name pattern (case-sensitive glob).
     'enable: boolean'
          Whether to enable tracing.
     'ignore-unavailable: boolean' (optional)
          Do not match unavailable events with 'name'.
     'vcpu: int' (optional)
          The vCPU to act upon (all by default; since 2.7).
     An event's state is modified if:
        - its name matches the 'name' pattern, and
        - if 'vcpu' is given, the event has the "vcpu" property.

     Therefore, if 'vcpu' is given, the operation will only match
     per-vCPU events, setting their state on the specified vCPU. Special
     case: if 'name' is an exact match, 'vcpu' is given and the event
     does not have the "vcpu" property, an error is returned.

     Since: 2.2

     Example:
          -> { "execute": "trace-event-set-state",
               "arguments": { "name": "qemu_memalign", "enable": "true" } }
          <- { "return": {} }

 -- Command: query-qmp-schema

     Command query-qmp-schema exposes the QMP wire ABI as an array of
     SchemaInfo.  This lets QMP clients figure out what commands and
     events are available in this QEMU, and their parameters and
     results.

     However, the SchemaInfo can't reflect all the rules and
     restrictions that apply to QMP. It's interface introspection
     (figuring out what's there), not interface specification.  The
     specification is in the QAPI schema.

     Furthermore, while we strive to keep the QMP wire format
     backwards-compatible across qemu versions, the introspection output
     is not guaranteed to have the same stability.  For example, one
     version of qemu may list an object member as an optional
     non-variant, while another lists the same member only through the
     object's variants; or the type of a member may change from a
     generic string into a specific enum or from one specific type into
     an alternate that includes the original type alongside something
     else.

     Returns: array of 'SchemaInfo', where each element describes an
     entity in the ABI: command, event, type, ...

     The order of the various SchemaInfo is unspecified; however, all
     names are guaranteed to be unique (no name will be duplicated with
     different meta-types).

     Note: the QAPI schema is also used to help define *internal*
     interfaces, by defining QAPI types.  These are not part of the QMP
     wire ABI, and therefore not returned by this command.

     Since: 2.5

 -- Enum: SchemaMetaType

     This is a 'SchemaInfo''s meta type, i.e.  the kind of entity it
     describes.

     Values:
     'builtin'
          a predefined type such as 'int' or 'bool'.
     'enum'
          an enumeration type
     'array'
          an array type
     'object'
          an object type (struct or union)
     'alternate'
          an alternate type
     'command'
          a QMP command

 -- Object: SchemaInfo

     Members:
     'name: string'
          the entity's name, inherited from 'base'.  The SchemaInfo is
          always referenced by this name.  Commands and events have the
          name defined in the QAPI schema.  Unlike command and event
          names, type names are not part of the wire ABI. Consequently,
          type names are meaningless strings here, although they are
          still guaranteed unique regardless of 'meta-type'.
     'meta-type: SchemaMetaType'
          the entity's meta type, inherited from 'base'.
     The members of 'SchemaInfoBuiltin' when 'meta-type' is "builtin"
     The members of 'SchemaInfoEnum' when 'meta-type' is "enum"
     The members of 'SchemaInfoArray' when 'meta-type' is "array"
     The members of 'SchemaInfoObject' when 'meta-type' is "object"
     The members of 'SchemaInfoAlternate' when 'meta-type' is "alternate"
     The members of 'SchemaInfoCommand' when 'meta-type' is "command"
     The members of 'SchemaInfoEvent' when 'meta-type' is "event"
     Additional members depend on the value of 'meta-type'.

     Since: 2.5

 -- Object: SchemaInfoBuiltin

     Additional SchemaInfo members for meta-type 'builtin'.

     Members:
     'json-type: JSONType'

     'setup-time: int' (optional)
          amount of setup time in milliseconds _before_ the iterations
          begin but _after_ the QMP command is issued.  This is designed
          to provide an accounting of any activities (such as RDMA

 -- Enum: MigrationCapability

     Migration capabilities enumeration

     Values:
     'xbzrle'
          Migration supports xbzrle (Xor Based Zero Run Length
          Encoding).  This feature allows us to minimize migration
          traffic for certain work loads, by sending compressed
          difference of the pages
     'rdma-pin-all'
          Controls whether or not the entire VM memory footprint is
          mlock()'d on demand or all at once.  Refer to docs/rdma.txt
          for usage.  Disabled by default.  (since 2.0)
     'zero-blocks'
          During storage migration encode blocks of zeroes efficiently.
          This essentially saves 1MB of zeroes per block on the wire.
          Enabling requires source and target VM to support this
          feature.  To enable it is sufficient to enable the capability
          on the source VM. The feature is disabled by default.  (since
          1.6)
     'compress'
          Use multiple compression threads to accelerate live migration.
          This feature can help to reduce the migration traffic, by
          sending compressed pages.  Please note that if compress and
          xbzrle are both on, compress only takes effect in the ram bulk
          stage, after that, it will be disabled and only xbzrle takes
          effect, this can help to minimize migration traffic.  The
          feature is disabled by default.  (since 2.4 )
     'events'
          generate events for each migration state change (since 2.4 )
     'auto-converge'
          If enabled, QEMU will automatically throttle down the guest to
          speed up convergence of RAM migration.  (since 1.6)
     'postcopy-ram'
          Start executing on the migration target before all of RAM has
          been migrated, pulling the remaining pages along as needed.
          NOTE: If the migration fails during postcopy the VM will fail.
          (since 2.6)
     'x-colo'
          If enabled, migration will never end, and the state of the VM
          on the primary side will be migrated continuously to the VM on
          secondary side, this process is called COarse-Grain LOck
          Stepping (COLO) for Non-stop Service.  (since 2.8)
     'release-ram'
          if enabled, qemu will free the migrated ram pages on the
          source during postcopy-ram migration.  (since 2.9)
     'block'
          If enabled, QEMU will also migrate the contents of all block
          devices.  Default is disabled.  A possible alternative uses
          mirror jobs to a builtin NBD server on the destination, which
          offers more flexibility.  (Since 2.10)
     'return-path'
          If enabled, migration will use the return path even for
          precopy.  (since 2.10)

 -- Enum: MigrationParameter

     Migration parameters enumeration

     Values:
     'compress-level'
          Set the compression level to be used in live migration, the
          compression level is an integer between 0 and 9, where 0 means
          no compression, 1 means the best compression speed, and 9
          means best compression ratio which will consume more CPU.
     'compress-threads'
          Set compression thread count to be used in live migration, the
          compression thread count is an integer between 1 and 255.
     'decompress-threads'
          Set decompression thread count to be used in live migration,
          the decompression thread count is an integer between 1 and
          255.  Usually, decompression is at least 4 times as fast as
          compression, so set the decompress-threads to the number about
          1/4 of compress-threads is adequate.
     'cpu-throttle-initial'
          Initial percentage of time guest cpus are throttled when
          migration auto-converge is activated.  The default value is
          20.  (Since 2.7)
     'cpu-throttle-increment'
          throttle percentage increase each time auto-converge detects
          that migration is not making progress.  The default value is
          10.  (Since 2.7)
     'tls-creds'
          ID of the 'tls-creds' object that provides credentials for
          establishing a TLS connection over the migration data channel.
          On the outgoing side of the migration, the credentials must be
          for a 'client' endpoint, while for the incoming side the
          credentials must be for a 'server' endpoint.  Setting this
          will enable TLS for all migrations.  The default is unset,
          resulting in unsecured migration at the QEMU level.  (Since
          2.7)
     'tls-hostname'
          hostname of the target host for the migration.  This is
          required when using x509 based TLS credentials and the
          migration URI does not already include a hostname.  For
          example if using fd: or exec: based migration, the hostname
          must be provided so that the server's x509 certificate
          identity can be validated.  (Since 2.7)
     'max-bandwidth'

          periodic mode.  (Since 2.8)
     'block-incremental'
          Affects how much storage is migrated when the block migration
          capability is enabled.  When false, the entire storage backing
          chain is migrated into a flattened image at the destination;
          when true, only the active qcow2 layer is migrated and the
          destination must already have access to the same backing chain
          as was used on the source.  (since 2.10)

 -- Command: quit

     This command will cause the QEMU process to exit gracefully.  While
     every attempt is made to send the QMP response before terminating,
     this is not guaranteed.  When using this interface, a premature EOF
     would not be unexpected.

          <- { "return": {} }

 -- Command: stop

     Stop all guest VCPU execution.

     Since: 0.14.0

     Notes: This function will succeed even if the guest is already in
     the stopped state.  In "inmigrate" state, it will ensure that the
     guest remains paused once migration finishes, as if the -S option
     was passed on the command line.

     Example:
          -> { "execute": "stop" }
          <- { "return": {} }

 -- Command: system_reset

     Performs a hard reset of a guest.

     Since: 0.14.0

     Example:
          -> { "execute": "system_reset" }
          <- { "return": {} }

 -- Command: system_powerdown

     Requests that a guest perform a powerdown operation.

     Since: 0.14.0

     Notes: A guest may or may not respond to this command.  This
     command returning does not indicate that a guest has accepted the
     request or that it has shut down.  Many guests will respond to this
     command by prompting the user in some way.

     Example:
          -> { "execute": "system_powerdown" }
          <- { "return": {} }

 -- Command: cpu

     This command is a nop that is only provided for the purposes of
     compatibility.

     Arguments:
     'index: int'
          Not documented

     Since: 0.14.0

     Notes: Do not use this command.

 -- Command: cpu-add

     Adds CPU with specified ID

     Arguments:
     'id: int'
          ID of CPU to be created, valid values [0..max_cpus)

     Returns: Nothing on success

     Since: 1.5

     Example:
          -> { "execute": "cpu-add", "arguments": { "id": 2 } }
          <- { "return": {} }

 -- Command: memsave

     Save a portion of guest memory to a file.

     Arguments:
     'val: int'
          the virtual address of the guest to start from
     'size: int'
          the size of memory region to save
     'filename: string'
          the file to save the memory to as binary data
     'cpu-index: int' (optional)
          the index of the virtual CPU to use for translating the
          virtual address (defaults to CPU 0)

     Returns: Nothing on success

     Since: 0.14.0

     Notes: Errors were not reliably returned until 1.1

     Example:
          -> { "execute": "memsave",
               "arguments": { "val": 10,
                              "size": 100,
                              "filename": "/tmp/virtual-mem-dump" } }
          <- { "return": {} }

 -- Command: pmemsave

     Save a portion of guest physical memory to a file.

     Arguments:
     'val: int'
          the physical address of the guest to start from
     'size: int'
          the size of memory region to save
     'filename: string'
          the file to save the memory to as binary data

     Returns: Nothing on success

     Since: 0.14.0

     Notes: Errors were not reliably returned until 1.1

     Example:
          -> { "execute": "pmemsave",
               "arguments": { "val": 10,
                              "size": 100,
                              "filename": "/tmp/physical-mem-dump" } }
          <- { "return": {} }

 -- Command: cont

     Resume guest VCPU execution.

     Since: 0.14.0

     Returns: If successful, nothing

     Notes: This command will succeed if the guest is currently running.
     It will also succeed if the guest is in the "inmigrate" state; in
     this case, the effect of the command is to make sure the guest
     starts once migration finishes, removing the effect of the -S
     command line option if it was passed.

     Example:
          -> { "execute": "cont" }
          <- { "return": {} }

 -- Command: system_wakeup

     Wakeup guest from suspend.  Does nothing in case the guest isn't
     suspended.

     Since: 1.1

     Returns: nothing.

     Example:
          -> { "execute": "system_wakeup" }
          <- { "return": {} }

 -- Command: inject-nmi

     Injects a Non-Maskable Interrupt into the default CPU (x86/s390) or
     all CPUs (ppc64).  The command fails when the guest doesn't support
     injecting.

     Returns: If successful, nothing

     Since: 0.14.0

     Note: prior to 2.1, this command was only supported for x86 and
     s390 VMs

     Example:
          -> { "execute": "inject-nmi" }
          <- { "return": {} }

 -- Command: set_link

     Sets the link status of a virtual network adapter.

     Arguments:
     'name: string'
          the device name of the virtual network adapter
     'up: boolean'
          true to set the link status to be up

     Returns: Nothing on success If 'name' is not a valid network
     device, DeviceNotFound

     Since: 0.14.0

     Notes: Not all network adapters support setting link status.  This
     command will succeed even if the network adapter does not support
     link status notification.

     Example:
          -> { "execute": "set_link",
               "arguments": { "name": "e1000.0", "up": false } }
          <- { "return": {} }

 -- Command: balloon

     Request the balloon driver to change its balloon size.

     Arguments:
     'value: int'
          the target size of the balloon in bytes

     Returns: Nothing on success If the balloon driver is enabled but
     not functional because the KVM kernel module cannot support it,
     KvmMissingCap If no balloon device is present, DeviceNotActive

     Notes: This command just issues a request to the guest.  When it
     returns, the balloon size may not have changed.  A guest can change
     the balloon size independent of this command.

     Since: 0.14.0

     Example:
          -> { "execute": "balloon", "arguments": { "value": 536870912 } }
          <- { "return": {} }

 -- Object: Abort

     This action can be used to test transaction failure.

     Since: 1.6

 -- Enum: ActionCompletionMode

     An enumeration of Transactional completion modes.

     Values:
     'individual'
          Do not attempt to cancel any other Actions if any Actions fail
          after the Transaction request succeeds.  All Actions that can
          complete successfully will do so without waiting on others.
          This is the default.
     'grouped'
          If any Action fails after the Transaction succeeds, cancel all
          Actions.  Actions do not complete until all Actions are ready
          to complete.  May be rejected by Actions that do not support
          this completion mode.

     Since: 2.5

 -- Object: TransactionAction

     A discriminated record of operations that can be performed with
     'transaction'.  Action 'type' can be:

        - 'abort': since 1.6
        - 'block-dirty-bitmap-add': since 2.5
        - 'block-dirty-bitmap-clear': since 2.5
        - 'blockdev-backup': since 2.3
        - 'blockdev-snapshot': since 2.5
        - 'blockdev-snapshot-internal-sync': since 1.7
        - 'blockdev-snapshot-sync': since 1.1
        - 'drive-backup': since 1.6

     Members:
     'type'
          One of "abort", "block-dirty-bitmap-add",
          "block-dirty-bitmap-clear", "blockdev-backup",
          "blockdev-snapshot", "blockdev-snapshot-internal-sync",
          "blockdev-snapshot-sync", "drive-backup"
     'data: Abort' when 'type' is "abort"
     'data: BlockDirtyBitmapAdd' when 'type' is "block-dirty-bitmap-add"
     'data: BlockDirtyBitmap' when 'type' is "block-dirty-bitmap-clear"
     'data: BlockdevBackup' when 'type' is "blockdev-backup"

     'data: BlockdevSnapshotSync' when 'type' is "blockdev-snapshot-sync"
     'data: DriveBackup' when 'type' is "drive-backup"

     Since: 1.1

 -- Object: TransactionProperties

     Optional arguments to modify the behavior of a Transaction.

     Members:
     'completion-mode: ActionCompletionMode' (optional)
          Controls how jobs launched asynchronously by Actions will
          complete or fail as a group.  See 'ActionCompletionMode' for
          details.

     Since: 2.5

 -- Command: transaction

     Executes a number of transactionable QMP commands atomically.  If
     any operation fails, then the entire set of actions will be
     abandoned and the appropriate error returned.

     For external snapshots, the dictionary contains the device, the
     file to use for the new snapshot, and the format.  The default
     format, if not specified, is qcow2.

     Each new snapshot defaults to being created by QEMU (wiping any
     contents if the file already exists), but it is also possible to
     reuse an externally-created file.  In the latter case, you should
     ensure that the new image file has the same contents as the current
     one; QEMU cannot perform any meaningful check.  Typically this is
     achieved by using the current image file as the backing file for
     the new image.

     On failure, the original disks pre-snapshot attempt will be used.

     For internal snapshots, the dictionary contains the device and the
     snapshot's name.  If an internal snapshot matching name already
     exists, the request will be rejected.  Only some image formats
     support it, for example, qcow2, rbd, and sheepdog.

     On failure, qemu will try delete the newly created internal
     snapshot in the transaction.  When an I/O error occurs during
     deletion, the user needs to fix it later with qemu-img or other
     command.

     Arguments:
     'actions: array of TransactionAction'
          List of 'TransactionAction'; information needed for the
          respective operations.
     'properties: TransactionProperties' (optional)
          structure of additional options to control the execution of
          the transaction.  See 'TransactionProperties' for additional
          detail.

     Returns: nothing on success

     Errors depend on the operations of the transaction

     Note: The transaction aborts on the first failure.  Therefore,
     there will be information on only one failed operation returned in
     an error condition, and subsequent actions will not have been
     attempted.

     Since: 1.1

     Example:
          -> { "execute": "transaction",
               "arguments": { "actions": [
                   { "type": "blockdev-snapshot-sync", "data" : { "device": "ide-hd0",

                                               "format": "qcow2" } },
                   { "type": "blockdev-snapshot-sync", "data" : { "node-name": "myfile",

                                               "name": "snapshot0" } } ] } }
          <- { "return": {} }

 -- Command: human-monitor-command

     Execute a command on the human monitor and return the output.

     Arguments:
     'command-line: string'
          the command to execute in the human monitor
     'cpu-index: int' (optional)
          The CPU to use for commands that require an implicit CPU

     Returns: the output of the command as a string

     Since: 0.14.0

     Notes: This command only exists as a stop-gap.  Its use is highly
     discouraged.  The semantics of this command are not guaranteed:
     this means that command names, arguments and responses can change
     or be removed at ANY time.  Applications that rely on long term
     stability guarantees should NOT use this command.

     Known limitations:

        * This command is stateless, this means that commands that
          depend on state information (such as getfd) might not work

        * Commands that prompt the user for data don't currently work

     Example:
          -> { "execute": "human-monitor-command",
               "arguments": { "command-line": "info kvm" } }
          <- { "return": "kvm support: enabled\r\n" }

 -- Command: migrate_cancel

     Cancel the current executing migration process.

     Returns: nothing on success

     Notes: This command succeeds even if there is no migration process
     running.

          <- { "return": {} }

 -- Command: migrate_set_speed

     Set maximum speed for migration.

     Arguments:
     'value: int'
          maximum speed in bytes per second.

     Returns: nothing on success

     Notes: This command is deprecated in favor of
     'migrate-set-parameters'

     Since: 0.14.0

     Example:
          -> { "execute": "migrate_set_speed", "arguments": { "value": 1024 } }
          <- { "return": {} }

 -- Command: migrate-set-cache-size

     Set cache size to be used by XBZRLE migration

     Arguments:
     'value: int'
          cache size in bytes
     The size will be rounded down to the nearest power of 2.  The cache
     size can be modified before and during ongoing migration

     Returns: nothing on success

     Since: 1.2

     Example:
          -> { "execute": "migrate-set-cache-size",
               "arguments": { "value": 536870912 } }

 -- Object: ObjectPropertyInfo

     Members:
     'name: string'
          the name of the property
     'type: string'
          the type of the property.  This will typically come in one of
          four forms:

          1) A primitive type such as 'u8', 'u16', 'bool', 'str', or
          'double'.  These types are mapped to the appropriate JSON
          type.

          2) A child type in the form 'child<subtype>' where subtype is
          a qdev device type name.  Child properties create the
          composition tree.

          3) A link type in the form 'link<subtype>' where subtype is a
          qdev device type name.  Link properties form the device model
          graph.

     Since: 1.2

 -- Command: qom-list

     This command will list any properties of a object given a path in
     the object model.

     Arguments:
     'path: string'
          the path within the object model.  See 'qom-get' for a
          description of this parameter.

     Returns: a list of 'ObjectPropertyInfo' that describe the
     properties of the object.

     Since: 1.2

 -- Command: qom-get

     This command will get a property from a object model path and
     return the value.

     Arguments:
     'path: string'
          The path within the object model.  There are two forms of
          supported paths-absolute and partial paths.

          Absolute paths are derived from the root object and can follow
          child<> or link<> properties.  Since they can follow link<>
          properties, they can be arbitrarily long.  Absolute paths look
          like absolute filenames and are prefixed with a leading slash.

          Partial paths look like relative filenames.  They do not begin
          with a prefix.  The matching rules for partial paths are
          subtle but designed to make specifying objects easy.  At each
          level of the composition tree, the partial path is matched as
          an absolute path.  The first match is not returned.  At least
          two matches are searched for.  A successful result is only
          returned if only one match is found.  If more than one match
          is found, a flag is return to indicate that the match was
          ambiguous.
     'property: string'
          The property name to read

     Returns: The property value.  The type depends on the property
     type.  child<> and link<> properties are returned as #str
     pathnames.  All integer property types (u8, u16, etc) are returned
     as #int.

     Since: 1.2

 -- Command: qom-set

     This command will set a property from a object model path.

     Arguments:
     'path: string'
          see 'qom-get' for a description of this parameter
     'property: string'
          the property name to set
     'value: value'
          a value who's type is appropriate for the property type.  See
          'qom-get' for a description of type mapping.

     Since: 1.2

 -- Command: set_password

     Sets the password of a remote display session.

     Arguments:
     'protocol: string'
          'vnc' to modify the VNC server password 'spice' to modify the
          Spice server password
     'password: string'
          the new password
     'connected: string' (optional)
          how to handle existing clients when changing the password.  If
          nothing is specified, defaults to 'keep' 'fail' to fail the
          command if clients are connected 'disconnect' to disconnect
          existing clients 'keep' to maintain existing clients

     Returns: Nothing on success If Spice is not enabled, DeviceNotFound

     Since: 0.14.0

     Example:
          -> { "execute": "set_password", "arguments": { "protocol": "vnc",
                                                         "password": "secret" } }
          <- { "return": {} }

 -- Command: expire_password

     Expire the password of a remote display server.

     Arguments:
     'protocol: string'
          the name of the remote display protocol 'vnc' or 'spice'
     'time: string'
          when to expire the password.  'now' to expire the password
          immediately 'never' to cancel password expiration '+INT' where
          INT is the number of seconds from now (integer) 'INT' where
          INT is the absolute time in seconds

     Returns: Nothing on success If 'protocol' is 'spice' and Spice is
     not active, DeviceNotFound

     Since: 0.14.0

     Notes: Time is relative to the server and currently there is no way
     to coordinate server time with client time.  It is not recommended
     to use the absolute time version of the 'time' parameter unless
     you're sure you are on the same machine as the QEMU instance.

     Example:
          -> { "execute": "expire_password", "arguments": { "protocol": "vnc",
                                                            "time": "+60" } }
          <- { "return": {} }

 -- Command: change-vnc-password

     Change the VNC server password.

     Arguments:
     'password: string'
          the new password to use with VNC authentication

     Since: 1.1

     Notes: An empty password in this command will set the password to
     the empty string.  Existing clients are unaffected by executing
     this command.

 -- Command: change

     This command is multiple commands multiplexed together.

     Arguments:
     'device: string'
          This is normally the name of a block device but it may also be
          'vnc'.  when it's 'vnc', then sub command depends on 'target'
     'target: string'
          If 'device' is a block device, then this is the new filename.
          If 'device' is 'vnc', then if the value 'password' selects the
          vnc change password command.  Otherwise, this specifies a new
          server URI address to listen to for VNC connections.
     'arg: string' (optional)
          If 'device' is a block device, then this is an optional format
          to open the device with.  If 'device' is 'vnc' and 'target' is
          'password', this is the new VNC password to set.  See
          change-vnc-password for additional notes.

     Returns: Nothing on success.  If 'device' is not a valid block
     device, DeviceNotFound

     Notes: This interface is deprecated, and it is strongly recommended
     that you avoid using it.  For changing block devices, use
     blockdev-change-medium; for changing VNC parameters, use
     change-vnc-password.

     Since: 0.14.0

     Example:
          1. Change a removable medium

          -> { "execute": "change",

     Arguments:
     'uri: string'
          the Uniform Resource Identifier of the destination VM
     'blk: boolean' (optional)
          do block migration (full disk copy)
     'inc: boolean' (optional)
          incremental disk copy migration
     'detach: boolean' (optional)
          this argument exists only for compatibility reasons and is
          ignored by QEMU

     Returns: nothing on success

     Since: 0.14.0

     Notes:
       1. The 'query-migrate' command should be used to check
          migration's progress and final result (this information is
          provided by the 'status' member)

       2. All boolean arguments default to false

       3. The user Monitor's "detach" argument is invalid in QMP and
          should not be used

     Example:
          -> { "execute": "migrate", "arguments": { "uri": "tcp:0:4446" } }
          <- { "return": {} }

 -- Command: migrate-incoming

     -incoming defer

     Arguments:
     'uri: string'
          The Uniform Resource Identifier identifying the source or
          address to listen on

     Returns: nothing on success

     Since: 2.3

     Notes:
       1. It's a bad idea to use a string for the uri, but it needs to
          stay compatible with -incoming and the format of the uri is
          already exposed above libvirt.

       2. QEMU must be started with -incoming defer to allow
          migrate-incoming to be used.

       3. The uri format is the same as for -incoming

     Example:
          -> { "execute": "migrate-incoming",
               "arguments": { "uri": "tcp::4446" } }
          <- { "return": {} }

     Example:
          -> { "execute": "xen-set-global-dirty-log",
               "arguments": { "enable": true } }
          <- { "return": {} }

 -- Command: device_add

     Arguments:
     'driver: string'
          the name of the new device's driver
     'bus: string' (optional)
          the device's parent bus (device tree path)

     Additional arguments depend on the type.

     Add a device.

     Notes:
       1. For detailed information about this command, please refer to
          the 'docs/qdev-device-use.txt' file.

       2. It's possible to list device properties by running QEMU with
          the "-device DEVICE,help" command-line argument, where DEVICE
          is the device's name

     Example:
          -> { "execute": "device_add",
               "arguments": { "driver": "e1000", "id": "net1",
                              "bus": "pci.0",
                              "mac": "52:54:00:12:34:56" } }
          <- { "return": {} }

     TODO: This command effectively bypasses QAPI completely due to its
     "additional arguments" business.  It shouldn't have been added to
     the schema in this form.  It should be qapified properly, or
     replaced by a properly qapified command.

     Since: 0.13

 -- Command: device_del

     Remove a device from a guest

     Arguments:
     'id: string'
          the device's ID or QOM path

     Returns: Nothing on success If 'id' is not a valid device,
     DeviceNotFound

     Notes: When this command completes, the device may not be removed
     from the guest.  Hot removal is an operation that requires guest
     cooperation.  This command merely requests that the guest begin the
     hot removal process.  Completion of the device removal process is
     signaled with a DEVICE_DELETED event.  Guest reset will
     automatically complete removal for all devices.

     Since: 0.14.0

     Example:
          -> { "execute": "device_del",
               "arguments": { "id": "net1" } }
          <- { "return": {} }

          -> { "execute": "device_del",

          kdump-compressed format with snappy-compressed

     Since: 2.0

 -- Command: dump-guest-memory

     Dump guest's memory to vmcore.  It is a synchronous operation that
     can take very long depending on the amount of guest memory.

     Arguments:
     'paging: boolean'
          if true, do paging to get guest's memory mapping.  This allows
          using gdb to process the core file.

          IMPORTANT: this option can make QEMU allocate several
          gigabytes of RAM. This can happen for a large guest, or a
          malicious guest pretending to be large.

          Also, paging=true has the following limitations:

            1. The guest may be in a catastrophic state or can have
               corrupted memory, which cannot be trusted
            2. The guest can be in real-mode even if paging is enabled.
               For example, the guest uses ACPI to sleep, and ACPI sleep
               state goes in real-mode
            3. Currently only supported on i386 and x86_64.

     'protocol: string'
          the filename or file descriptor of the vmcore.  The supported
          protocols are:

            1. file: the protocol starts with "file:", and the following
               string is the file's path.
            2. fd: the protocol starts with "fd:", and the following
               string is the fd's name.

     'detach: boolean' (optional)
          if true, QMP will return immediately rather than waiting for
          the dump to finish.  The user can track progress using
          "query-dump".  (since 2.6).
     'begin: int' (optional)
          if specified, the starting physical address.
     'length: int' (optional)
          if specified, the memory size, in bytes.  If you don't want to
          dump all guest's memory, please specify the start 'begin' and
          'length'
     'format: DumpGuestMemoryFormat' (optional)
          if specified, the format of guest memory dump.  But non-elf
          format is conflict with paging and filter, ie.  'paging',
          'begin' and 'length' is not allowed to be specified with
          non-elf 'format' at the same time (since 2.0)

     Note: All boolean arguments default to false

     Returns: nothing on success

     Virtual CPU definition.

     Members:
     'name: string'
          the name of the CPU definition
     'migration-safe: boolean' (optional)
          whether a CPU definition can be safely used for migration in
          combination with a QEMU compatibility machine when migrating
          between different QMU versions and between hosts with
          different sets of (hardware or software) capabilities.  If not
          provided, information is not available and callers should not
          assume the CPU definition to be migration-safe.  (since 2.8)
     'static: boolean'
          whether a CPU definition is static and will not change
          depending on QEMU version, machine type, machine options and
          accelerator options.  A static model is always migration-safe.

          Type name that can be used as argument to
          'device-list-properties', to introspect properties
          configurable using -cpu or -global.  (since 2.9)
     'unavailable-features' is a list of QOM property names that
     represent CPU model attributes that prevent the CPU from running.
     If the QOM property is read-only, that means there's no known way
     to make the CPU model run in the current host.  Implementations
     that choose not to provide specific information return the property
     name "type".  If the property is read-write, it means that it MAY
     be possible to run the CPU model in the current host if that
     property is changed.  Management software can use it as hints to
     suggest or choose an alternative for the user, or just to generate
     meaningful error messages explaining why the CPU model can't be
     used.  If 'unavailable-features' is an empty list, the CPU model is
     runnable using the current host and machine-type.  If
     'unavailable-features' is not present, runnability information for
     the CPU is not available.

     Virtual CPU model.

     A CPU model consists of the name of a CPU definition, to which
     delta changes are applied (e.g.  features added/removed).  Most
     magic values that an architecture might require should be hidden
     behind the name.  However, if required, architectures can expose
     relevant properties.

     'props: value' (optional)
          a dictionary of QOM properties to be applied

     Since: 2.8.0

 -- Enum: CpuModelExpansionType

     An enumeration of CPU model expansion types.

     Values:
     'static'
          Expand to a static CPU model, a combination of a static base
          model name and property delta changes.  As the static base
          model will never change, the expanded CPU model will be the
          same, independant of independent of QEMU version, machine
          type, machine options, and accelerator options.  Therefore,
          the resulting model can be used by tooling without having to
          specify a compatibility machine - e.g.  when displaying the
          "host" model.  static CPU models are migration-safe.
     'full'
          Expand all properties.  The produced model is not guaranteed
          to be migration-safe, but allows tooling to get an insight and
          work with model details.

     Note: When a non-migration-safe CPU model is expanded in static
     mode, some features enabled by the CPU model may be omitted,
     because they can't be implemented by a static CPU model definition
     (e.g.  cache info passthrough and PMU passthrough in x86).  If you
     need an accurate representation of the features enabled by a
     non-migration-safe CPU model, use 'full'.  If you need a static
     representation that will keep ABI compatibility even when changing
     QEMU version or machine-type, use 'static' (but keep in mind that
     some features may be omitted).

 -- Object: CpuModelExpansionInfo

 -- Command: query-cpu-model-expansion

     Expands a given CPU model (or a combination of CPU model +
     additional options) to different granularities, allowing tooling to
     get an understanding what a specific CPU model looks like in QEMU
     under a certain configuration.

     This interface can be used to query the "host" CPU model.

     The data returned by this command may be affected by:

        * QEMU version: CPU models may look different depending on the
          QEMU version.  (Except for CPU models reported as "static" in
          query-cpu-definitions.)
        * machine-type: CPU model may look different depending on the
          machine-type.  (Except for CPU models reported as "static" in
          query-cpu-definitions.)
        * machine options (including accelerator): in some
          architectures, CPU models may look different depending on
          machine and accelerator options.  (Except for CPU models
          reported as "static" in query-cpu-definitions.)
        * "-cpu" arguments and global properties: arguments to the -cpu
          option and global properties may affect expansion of CPU
          models.  Using query-cpu-model-expansion while using these is
          not advised.

     Some architectures may not support all expansion types.  s390x
     supports "full" and "static".

     Arguments:
     'type: CpuModelExpansionType'
          Not documented
     'model: CpuModelInfo'
          Not documented

     Returns: a CpuModelExpansionInfo.  Returns an error if expanding
     CPU models is not supported, if the model cannot be expanded, if
     the model contains an unknown CPU definition name, unknown
     properties or properties with a wrong type.  Also returns an error
     if an expansion type is not supported.

     Since: 2.8.0

 -- Enum: CpuModelCompareResult

     An enumeration of CPU model comparation results.  The result is
     usually calculated using e.g.  CPU features or CPU generations.

     Values:
     'incompatible'
          If model A is incompatible to model B, model A is not
          guaranteed to run where model B runs and the other way around.
     'identical'
          If model A is identical to model B, model A is guaranteed to
          run where model B runs and the other way around.
     'superset'
          If model A is a superset of model B, model B is guaranteed to
          run where model A runs.  There are no guarantees about the
          other way.
     'subset'
          If model A is a subset of model B, model A is guaranteed to
          run where model B runs.  There are no guarantees about the
          other way.

 -- Object: CpuModelCompareInfo

     The result of a CPU model comparison.

     Members:
     'result: CpuModelCompareResult'
          The result of the compare operation.
     'responsible-properties: array of string'
          List of properties that led to the comparison result not being
          identical.
     'responsible-properties' is a list of QOM property names that led
     to both CPUs not being detected as identical.  For identical
     models, this list is empty.  If a QOM property is read-only, that
     means there's no known way to make the CPU models identical.  If
     the special property name "type" is included, the models are by
     definition not identical and cannot be made identical.

     Since: 2.8.0

 -- Command: query-cpu-model-comparison

     Compares two CPU models, returning how they compare in a specific
     configuration.  The results indicates how both models compare
     regarding runnability.  This result can be used by tooling to make
     decisions if a certain CPU model will run in a certain
     configuration or if a compatible CPU model has to be created by
     baselining.

     Usually, a CPU model is compared against the maximum possible CPU
     model of a certain configuration (e.g.  the "host" model for KVM).
     If that CPU model is identical or a subset, it will run in that
     configuration.

     The result returned by this command may be affected by:

        * QEMU version: CPU models may look different depending on the
          QEMU version.  (Except for CPU models reported as "static" in
          query-cpu-definitions.)
        * machine-type: CPU model may look different depending on the
          machine-type.  (Except for CPU models reported as "static" in
          query-cpu-definitions.)
        * machine options (including accelerator): in some
          architectures, CPU models may look different depending on
          machine and accelerator options.  (Except for CPU models
          reported as "static" in query-cpu-definitions.)
        * "-cpu" arguments and global properties: arguments to the -cpu
          option and global properties may affect expansion of CPU
          models.  Using query-cpu-model-expansion while using these is
          not advised.

     Some architectures may not support comparing CPU models.  s390x
     supports comparing CPU models.

     Arguments:
     'modela: CpuModelInfo'
          Not documented
     'modelb: CpuModelInfo'
          Not documented

     Returns: a CpuModelBaselineInfo.  Returns an error if comparing CPU
     models is not supported, if a model cannot be used, if a model
     contains an unknown cpu definition name, unknown properties or
     properties with wrong types.

 -- Object: CpuModelBaselineInfo

     The result of a CPU model baseline.

     Members:
     'model: CpuModelInfo'
          the baselined CpuModelInfo.

     Since: 2.8.0

 -- Command: query-cpu-model-baseline

     Baseline two CPU models, creating a compatible third model.  The
     created model will always be a static, migration-safe CPU model
     (see "static" CPU model expansion for details).

     This interface can be used by tooling to create a compatible CPU
     model out two CPU models.  The created CPU model will be identical
     to or a subset of both CPU models when comparing them.  Therefore,
     the created CPU model is guaranteed to run where the given CPU
     models run.

     The result returned by this command may be affected by:

        * QEMU version: CPU models may look different depending on the
          QEMU version.  (Except for CPU models reported as "static" in
          query-cpu-definitions.)
        * machine-type: CPU model may look different depending on the
          machine-type.  (Except for CPU models reported as "static" in
          query-cpu-definitions.)
        * machine options (including accelerator): in some
          architectures, CPU models may look different depending on
          machine and accelerator options.  (Except for CPU models
          reported as "static" in query-cpu-definitions.)
        * "-cpu" arguments and global properties: arguments to the -cpu
          option and global properties may affect expansion of CPU
          models.  Using query-cpu-model-expansion while using these is
          not advised.

     Some architectures may not support baselining CPU models.  s390x
     supports baselining CPU models.

     Arguments:
     'modela: CpuModelInfo'
          Not documented
     'modelb: CpuModelInfo'
          Not documented

     Returns: a CpuModelBaselineInfo.  Returns an error if baselining
     CPU models is not supported, if a model cannot be used, if a model
     contains an unknown cpu definition name, unknown properties or
     properties with wrong types.

 -- Command: input-send-event

     Send input event(s) to guest.

     Arguments:
     'device: string' (optional)
          display device to send event(s) to.
     'head: int' (optional)
          head to send event(s) to, in case the display device supports

     Returns: Nothing on success.

     The 'device' and 'head' parameters can be used to send the input
     event to specific input devices in case (a) multiple input devices
     of the same kind are added to the virtual machine and (b) you have
     configured input routing (see docs/multiseat.txt) for those input
     devices.  The parameters work exactly like the device and head
     properties of input devices.  If 'device' is missing, only devices
     that have no input routing config are admissible.  If 'device' is
     specified, both input devices with and without input routing config
     are admissible, but devices with input routing config take
     precedence.

.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
General note concerning the use of guest agent interfaces:
.PP
\&\*(L"unsupported\*(R" is a higher-level error than the errors that individual
commands might document. The caller should always be prepared to receive
\&\s-1QERR_UNSUPPORTED,\s0 even if the given command doesn't specify it, or doesn't
document any failure mode at all.
.PP
\&\fBguest-sync-delimited\fR  (Command)
Echo back a unique integer value, and prepend to response a
leading sentinel byte (0xFF) the client can check scan for.
.PP
This is used by clients talking to the guest agent over the
wire to ensure the stream is in sync and doesn't contain stale
data from previous client. It must be issued upon initial
connection, and after any client-side timeouts (including
timeouts on receiving a response to this command).
.PP
After issuing this request, all guest agent responses should be
ignored until the response containing the unique integer value
the client passed in is returned. Receival of the 0xFF sentinel
byte must be handled as an indication that the client's
lexer/tokenizer/parser state should be flushed/reset in
preparation for reliably receiving the subsequent response. As
an optimization, clients may opt to ignore all data until a
sentinel value is receiving to avoid unnecessary processing of
stale data.
.PP
Similarly, clients should also precede this \fBrequest\fR
with a 0xFF byte to make sure the guest agent flushes any
partially read \s-1JSON\s0 data from a previous client connection.
.PP
\&\fBArguments:\fR
.ie n .IP """id: int""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CWid: int\fR" 4
.IX Item "id: int"
randomly generated 64\-bit integer
.PP
\&\fBReturns:\fR
The unique integer id passed in by the client
.PP
\&\fBSince:\fR
1.1
.PP
\&\fBguest-sync\fR  (Command)
Echo back a unique integer value
.PP
This is used by clients talking to the guest agent over the
wire to ensure the stream is in sync and doesn't contain stale
data from previous client. All guest agent responses should be
ignored until the provided unique integer value is returned,
and it is up to the client to handle stale whole or
partially-delivered \s-1JSON\s0 text in such a way that this response
can be obtained.
.PP
In cases where a partial stale response was previously
received by the client, this cannot always be done reliably.
One particular scenario being if qemu-ga responses are fed
character-by-character into a \s-1JSON\s0 parser. In these situations,
using guest-sync-delimited may be optimal.
.PP
For clients that fetch responses line by line and convert them
to \s-1JSON\s0 objects, guest-sync should be sufficient, but note that
in cases where the channel is dirty some attempts at parsing the
response may result in a parser error.
.PP
Such clients should also precede this command
with a 0xFF byte to make sure the guest agent flushes any
partially read \s-1JSON\s0 data from a previous session.

\&\fBguest-ping\fR  (Command)

.PP

.PP
\&\fBguest-get-time\fR  (Command)
Get the information about guest's System Time relative to

.PP
\&\fBReturns:\fR
Time in nanoseconds.
.PP
\&\fBSince:\fR
1.5
.PP
\&\fBguest-set-time\fR  (Command)
Set guest time.
.PP
When a guest is paused or migrated to a file then loaded
from that file, the guest \s-1OS\s0 has no idea that there
was a big gap in the time. Depending on how long the
gap was, \s-1NTP\s0 might not be able to resynchronize the
guest.
.PP
This command tries to set guest's System Time to the
given value, then sets the Hardware Clock (\s-1RTC\s0) to the
current System Time. This will make it easier for a guest
to resynchronize without waiting for \s-1NTP.\s0 If no \f(CW\*(C`time\*(C'\fR is
specified, then the time to set is read from \s-1RTC.\s0 However,
this may not be supported on all platforms (i.e. Windows).
If that's the case users are advised to always pass a
value.

On \s-1POSIX\s0 systems the fields \f(CW\*(C`id\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`name\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`pretty\-name\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`version\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`version\-id\*(C'\fR,
\&\f(CW\*(C`variant\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`variant\-id\*(C'\fR follow the definition specified in \fIos\-release\fR\|(5).
Refer to the manual page for exact description of the fields. Their values
are taken from the os-release file. If the file is not present in the system,
or the values are not present in the file, the fields are not included.
.PP
On Windows the values are filled from information gathered from the system.

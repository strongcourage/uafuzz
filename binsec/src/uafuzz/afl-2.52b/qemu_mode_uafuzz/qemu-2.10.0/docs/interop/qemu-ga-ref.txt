General note concerning the use of guest agent interfaces:

"unsupported" is a higher-level error than the errors that individual
commands might document.  The caller should always be prepared to
receive QERR_UNSUPPORTED, even if the given command doesn't specify it,
or doesn't document any failure mode at all.

 -- Command: guest-sync-delimited

     Echo back a unique integer value, and prepend to response a leading
     sentinel byte (0xFF) the client can check scan for.

     This is used by clients talking to the guest agent over the wire to
     ensure the stream is in sync and doesn't contain stale data from
     previous client.  It must be issued upon initial connection, and
     after any client-side timeouts (including timeouts on receiving a
     response to this command).

     After issuing this request, all guest agent responses should be
     ignored until the response containing the unique integer value the
     client passed in is returned.  Receival of the 0xFF sentinel byte
     must be handled as an indication that the client's
     lexer/tokenizer/parser state should be flushed/reset in preparation
     for reliably receiving the subsequent response.  As an
     optimization, clients may opt to ignore all data until a sentinel
     value is receiving to avoid unnecessary processing of stale data.

     Similarly, clients should also precede this *request* with a 0xFF
     byte to make sure the guest agent flushes any partially read JSON
     data from a previous client connection.

     Arguments:
     'id: int'
          randomly generated 64-bit integer

     Returns: The unique integer id passed in by the client

     Since: 1.1

 -- Command: guest-sync

     Echo back a unique integer value

     This is used by clients talking to the guest agent over the wire to
     ensure the stream is in sync and doesn't contain stale data from
     previous client.  All guest agent responses should be ignored until
     the provided unique integer value is returned, and it is up to the
     client to handle stale whole or partially-delivered JSON text in
     such a way that this response can be obtained.

     In cases where a partial stale response was previously received by
     the client, this cannot always be done reliably.  One particular
     scenario being if qemu-ga responses are fed character-by-character
     into a JSON parser.  In these situations, using
     guest-sync-delimited may be optimal.

     For clients that fetch responses line by line and convert them to
     JSON objects, guest-sync should be sufficient, but note that in
     cases where the channel is dirty some attempts at parsing the
     response may result in a parser error.

     Such clients should also precede this command with a 0xFF byte to
     make sure the guest agent flushes any partially read JSON data from
     a previous session.

     Arguments:
     'id: int'
          randomly generated 64-bit integer

     Returns: The unique integer id passed in by the client

     Since: 0.15.0

 -- Command: guest-ping

     Ping the guest agent, a non-error return implies success

     Since: 0.15.0

 -- Command: guest-get-time

     Get the information about guest's System Time relative to the Epoch
     of 1970-01-01 in UTC.

     Returns: Time in nanoseconds.

     Since: 1.5

 -- Command: guest-set-time

     Set guest time.

     When a guest is paused or migrated to a file then loaded from that
     file, the guest OS has no idea that there was a big gap in the
     time.  Depending on how long the gap was, NTP might not be able to
     resynchronize the guest.

     This command tries to set guest's System Time to the given value,
     then sets the Hardware Clock (RTC) to the current System Time.
     This will make it easier for a guest to resynchronize without
     waiting for NTP. If no 'time' is specified, then the time to set is
     read from RTC. However, this may not be supported on all platforms
     (i.e.  Windows).  If that's the case users are advised to always
     pass a value.

     Arguments:
     'time: int' (optional)
          time of nanoseconds, relative to the Epoch of 1970-01-01 in
          UTC.

     Returns: Nothing on success.

     Arguments:
     'mode: string' (optional)
          "halt", "powerdown" (default), or "reboot"

 -- Enum: GuestFsfreezeStatus

     An enumeration of filesystem freeze states

     Values:
     'thawed'
          filesystems thawed/unfrozen
     'frozen'
          all non-network guest filesystems frozen

     Since: 0.15.0

 -- Command: guest-fsfreeze-status

     Get guest fsfreeze state.  error state indicates

     Returns: GuestFsfreezeStatus ("thawed", "frozen", etc., as defined
     below)

     Note: This may fail to properly report the current state as a
     result of some other guest processes having issued an fs
     freeze/thaw.

     Since: 0.15.0

 -- Command: guest-fsfreeze-freeze

     Sync and freeze all freezable, local guest filesystems.  If this
     command succeeded, you may call 'guest-fsfreeze-thaw' later to
     unfreeze.

     Note: On Windows, the command is implemented with the help of a
     Volume Shadow-copy Service DLL helper.  The frozen state is limited
     for up to 10 seconds by VSS.

     Returns: Number of file systems currently frozen.  On error, all
     filesystems will be thawed.

     Since: 0.15.0

 -- Command: guest-fsfreeze-freeze-list

     Sync and freeze specified guest filesystems.  See also
     'guest-fsfreeze-freeze'.

     Arguments:
     'mountpoints: array of string' (optional)
          an array of mountpoints of filesystems to be frozen.  If
          omitted, every mounted filesystem is frozen.  Invalid mount
          points are ignored.

     Returns: Number of file systems currently frozen.  On error, all
     filesystems will be thawed.

     Since: 2.2

 -- Command: guest-fsfreeze-thaw

     Unfreeze all frozen guest filesystems

     Returns: Number of file systems thawed by this call

     Note: if return value does not match the previous call to
     guest-fsfreeze-freeze, this likely means some freezable filesystems
     were unfrozen before this call, and that the filesystem state may
     have changed before issuing this command.

     Since: 0.15.0

 -- Object: GuestFilesystemTrimResult

     Members:
     'path: string'
          path that was trimmed
     'error: string' (optional)
          an error message when trim failed
     'trimmed: int' (optional)
          bytes trimmed for this path
     'minimum: int' (optional)
          reported effective minimum for this path

     Since: 2.4

 -- Object: GuestFilesystemTrimResponse

     Members:
     'paths: array of GuestFilesystemTrimResult'
          list of 'GuestFilesystemTrimResult' per path that was trimmed

     Since: 2.4

 -- Command: guest-fstrim

     Discard (or "trim") blocks which are not in use by the filesystem.

     Arguments:
     'minimum: int' (optional)
          Minimum contiguous free range to discard, in bytes.  Free
          ranges smaller than this may be ignored (this is a hint and
          the guest may not respect it).  By increasing this value, the
          fstrim operation will complete more quickly for filesystems
          with badly fragmented free space, although not all blocks will
          be discarded.  The default value is zero, meaning "discard
          every free block".

     Returns: A 'GuestFilesystemTrimResponse' which contains the status
     of all trimmed paths.  (since 2.4)

     Since: 1.2

 -- Command: guest-suspend-disk

     Suspend guest to disk.

     This command tries to execute the scripts provided by the pm-utils
     package.  If it's not available, the suspend operation will be
     performed by manually writing to a sysfs file.

     For the best results it's strongly recommended to have the pm-utils
     package installed in the guest.

     This command does NOT return a response on success.  There is a
     high chance the command succeeded if the VM exits with a zero exit
     status or, when running with -no-shutdown, by issuing the
     query-status QMP command to to confirm the VM status is "shutdown".
     However, the VM could also exit (or set its status to "shutdown")
     due to other reasons.

     The following errors may be returned: If suspend to disk is not
     supported, Unsupported

     Notes: It's strongly recommended to issue the guest-sync command
     before sending commands when the guest resumes

     Since: 1.1

 -- Command: guest-suspend-ram

     Suspend guest to ram.

     This command tries to execute the scripts provided by the pm-utils
     package.  If it's not available, the suspend operation will be
     performed by manually writing to a sysfs file.

     For the best results it's strongly recommended to have the pm-utils
     package installed in the guest.

     IMPORTANT: guest-suspend-ram requires QEMU to support the
     'system_wakeup' command.  Thus, it's *required* to query QEMU for
     the presence of the 'system_wakeup' command before issuing
     guest-suspend-ram.

     This command does NOT return a response on success.  There are two
     options to check for success:
       1. Wait for the SUSPEND QMP event from QEMU
       2. Issue the query-status QMP command to confirm the VM status is
          "suspended"

     The following errors may be returned: If suspend to ram is not
     supported, Unsupported

     Notes: It's strongly recommended to issue the guest-sync command
     before sending commands when the guest resumes

     Since: 1.1

 -- Command: guest-suspend-hybrid

     Save guest state to disk and suspend to ram.

     This command requires the pm-utils package to be installed in the
     guest.

     IMPORTANT: guest-suspend-hybrid requires QEMU to support the
     'system_wakeup' command.  Thus, it's *required* to query QEMU for
     the presence of the 'system_wakeup' command before issuing
     guest-suspend-hybrid.

     This command does NOT return a response on success.  There are two
     options to check for success:
       1. Wait for the SUSPEND QMP event from QEMU
       2. Issue the query-status QMP command to confirm the VM status is
          "suspended"

     The following errors may be returned: If hybrid suspend is not
     supported, Unsupported

     Notes: It's strongly recommended to issue the guest-sync command
     before sending commands when the guest resumes

     Since: 1.1

 -- Enum: GuestIpAddressType

     An enumeration of supported IP address types

     Values:
     'ipv4'
          IP version 4
     'ipv6'
          IP version 6

     Since: 1.1

     Members:
     'ip-address: string'
          IP address
     'ip-address-type: GuestIpAddressType'
          Type of 'ip-address' (e.g.  ipv4, ipv6)
     'prefix: int'
          Network prefix length of 'ip-address'

     Since: 1.1

 -- Object: GuestNetworkInterface

     Members:
     'name: string'
          The name of interface for which info are being delivered
     'hardware-address: string' (optional)
          Hardware address of 'name'
     'ip-addresses: array of GuestIpAddress' (optional)
          List of addresses assigned to 'name'

     Since: 1.1

 -- Command: guest-network-get-interfaces

     Get list of guest IP addresses, MAC addresses and netmasks.

     Returns: List of GuestNetworkInfo on success.

     Since: 1.1

 -- Object: GuestLogicalProcessor

     Members:
     'logical-id: int'
          Arbitrary guest-specific unique identifier of the VCPU.
     'online: boolean'
          Whether the VCPU is enabled.
     'can-offline: boolean' (optional)
          Whether offlining the VCPU is possible.  This member is always
          filled in by the guest agent when the structure is returned,
          and always ignored on input (hence it can be omitted then).

     Since: 1.5

 -- Command: guest-get-vcpus

     Retrieve the list of the guest's logical processors.

     This is a read-only operation.

     Returns: The list of all VCPUs the guest knows about.  Each VCPU is
     put on the list exactly once, but their order is unspecified.

     Since: 1.5

 -- Command: guest-set-vcpus

     Attempt to reconfigure (currently: enable/disable) logical
     processors inside the guest.

     The input list is processed node by node in order.  In each node
     'logical-id' is used to look up the guest VCPU, for which 'online'
     specifies the requested state.  The set of distinct 'logical-id''s
     is only required to be a subset of the guest-supported identifiers.
     There's no restriction on list length or on repeating the same
     'logical-id' (with possibly different 'online' field).  Preferably
     the input list should describe a modified subset of
     'guest-get-vcpus'' return value.

     Arguments:
     'vcpus: array of GuestLogicalProcessor'
          Not documented

     Returns: The length of the initial sublist that has been
     successfully processed.  The guest agent maximizes this value.
     Possible cases:

        - 0: if the 'vcpus' list was empty on input.  Guest state has
          not been changed.  Otherwise,
        - Error: processing the first node of 'vcpus' failed for the
          reason returned.  Guest state has not been changed.
          Otherwise,
        - < length('vcpus'): more than zero initial nodes have been
          processed, but not the entire 'vcpus' list.  Guest state has
          changed accordingly.  To retrieve the error (assuming it
          persists), repeat the call with the successfully processed
          initial sublist removed.  Otherwise,
        - length('vcpus'): call successful.

     Since: 1.5

 -- Command: guest-get-fsinfo

     Returns: The list of filesystems information mounted in the guest.
     The returned mountpoints may be specified to
     'guest-fsfreeze-freeze-list'.  Network filesystems (such as CIFS
     and NFS) are not listed.

          the user account whose password to change
     'password: string'
          the new password entry string, base64 encoded
     'crypted: boolean'
          true if password is already crypt()d, false if raw
     If the 'crypted' flag is true, it is the caller's responsibility to
     ensure the correct crypt() encryption scheme is used.  This command
     does not attempt to interpret or report on the encryption scheme.
     Refer to the documentation of the guest operating system in
     question to determine what is supported.

     Not all guest operating systems will support use of the 'crypted'
     flag, as they may require the clear-text password

     The 'password' parameter must always be base64 encoded before
     transmission, even if already crypt()d, to ensure it is 8-bit safe
     when passed as JSON.

     Returns: Nothing on success.

          Arbitrary guest-specific unique identifier of the MEMORY
          BLOCK.
     'online: boolean'
          Whether the MEMORY BLOCK is enabled in guest.
     'can-offline: boolean' (optional)
          Whether offlining the MEMORY BLOCK is possible.  This member
          is always filled in by the guest agent when the structure is
          returned, and always ignored on input (hence it can be omitted
          then).

     Since: 2.3

 -- Command: guest-get-memory-blocks

     Retrieve the list of the guest's memory blocks.

     This is a read-only operation.

     Returns: The list of all memory blocks the guest knows about.  Each
     memory block is put on the list exactly once, but their order is
     unspecified.

     Since: 2.3

 -- Enum: GuestMemoryBlockResponseType

     An enumeration of memory block operation result.

     Values:
     'success'
          the operation of online/offline memory block is successful.
     'not-found'
          can't find the corresponding memoryXXX directory in sysfs.
     'operation-not-supported'
          for some old kernels, it does not support online or offline
          memory block.
     'operation-failed'
          the operation of online/offline memory block fails, because of
          some errors happen.

     Since: 2.3

 -- Object: GuestMemoryBlockResponse

     Members:
     'phys-index: int'
          same with the 'phys-index' member of 'GuestMemoryBlock'.
     'response: GuestMemoryBlockResponseType'
          the result of memory block operation.
     'error-code: int' (optional)
          the error number.  When memory block operation fails, we
          assign the value of 'errno' to this member, it indicates what
          goes wrong.  When the operation succeeds, it will be omitted.

     Since: 2.3

 -- Command: guest-set-memory-blocks

     Attempt to reconfigure (currently: enable/disable) state of memory
     blocks inside the guest.

     The input list is processed node by node in order.  In each node
     'phys-index' is used to look up the guest MEMORY BLOCK, for which
     'online' specifies the requested state.  The set of distinct
     'phys-index''s is only required to be a subset of the
     guest-supported identifiers.  There's no restriction on list length
     or on repeating the same 'phys-index' (with possibly different
     'online' field).  Preferably the input list should describe a
     modified subset of 'guest-get-memory-blocks'' return value.

     Arguments:
     'mem-blks: array of GuestMemoryBlock'
          Not documented

     Returns: The operation results, it is a list of
     'GuestMemoryBlockResponse', which is corresponding to the input
     list.

     Note: it will return NULL if the 'mem-blks' list was empty on
     input, or there is an error, and in this case, guest state will not
     be changed.

     Since: 2.3

 -- Object: GuestMemoryBlockInfo

     Members:
     'size: int'
          the size (in bytes) of the guest memory blocks, which are the

          called Logical Memory Hotplug).

     Since: 2.3

 -- Command: guest-get-memory-block-info

     Get information relating to guest memory blocks.

     Returns: 'GuestMemoryBlockInfo'

     Since: 2.3

          'err-data' are present only if 'capture-output' was specified
          for 'guest-exec'
     'out-truncated: boolean' (optional)
          true if stdout was not fully captured due to size limitation.
     'err-truncated: boolean' (optional)
          true if stderr was not fully captured due to size limitation.

     Since: 2.5

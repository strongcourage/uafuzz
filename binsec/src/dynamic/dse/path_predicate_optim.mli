(** Path_predicate_formula optimizations *)


(** {2 Constant propagation}

    Functions trying to propagate constants on the
    given expression.
    @return the expression simplified *)

  ?recursive:int -> Formula.bl_term -> Formula.bl_term

val propagate_cst_abv :
  Path_predicate_env.formula ->
  ?recursive:int -> Formula.ax_term -> Formula.ax_term


(** {2 Rebase}

    In the formula all the variables are in a SSA
    form. The rebase optimization will intent to
    redefine variables used in the expression by
    older variables declaration eg:
    esp1 := esp0 + 4
    esp2 := esp1 + 4
    esp3 := esp2 + 4 => esp2+4 will be replaced by esp1+8
    thus obsolating the esp2 declaration. This reduce
    the number of variables defined and is crucial for some
    other optimizations *)

  Path_predicate_env.formula -> Formula.bl_term -> Formula.bl_term

val rebase_bvexpr :
  Path_predicate_env.formula -> Formula.bv_term -> Formula.bv_term

val rebase_abvexpr :
  Path_predicate_env.formula -> Formula.ax_term -> Formula.ax_term


(** {2 Read-Over-Write}

    The Read-Over-Write as an array theory optimization
    based on the fact that read(store(M, addr, X),addr) = X.
    Thus the optimization will try for every read to replace
    it by its store value (if any). To do so the classic linear
    method look in the store chain if the read address has
    previously been written. The hybrid method does the same
    but in a more efficient manner. *)

(** @return some stats about replacement that took place
    in the RoW optimization. Return values are:
    - min number of iteration for the lookup
    - max number of iteration for the lookup
    - moy number of iteration for the lookup
    - found number of read replaced
    - rebase number of read rebased on an older memory
    - disjoint others *)

  Path_predicate_env.formula ->
  string ->
  Formula.ax_term -> Path_predicate_env.hybrid_mem_t * Formula.ax_term

val read_over_write_hybrid :

val read_over_write_hybrid_bv :
  Path_predicate_env.formula -> Formula.bv_term -> Formula.bv_term

val read_over_write_hybrid_abv :

(** {2 Memory flattening}

    We call memory flattening the act of removing
    every array operations in the specific cases
    where all select/store are being made on constant
    addresses. This allows to generate formulas "solvable"
    by solvers not supporting the SMT array theory *)

    bitvector values *)

  (** @return all the bitvector inputs that have been
      created by replacing select in memory by bitvectors *)
